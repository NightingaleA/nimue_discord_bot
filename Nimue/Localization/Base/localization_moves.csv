**•** If the faction has a relevant asset, add 1.
**•** If their quarry is of the same Circle, add 1.
**•** If the faction is Size-1 or Strength-1, subtract 1.
**•** If their quarry is actively hiding, subtract 1.

If the quarry is an NPC: 
**On a 7-9**, the faction finds their quarry; they attack them, kidnap them, or confront them at some cost.
**On a 10+**, they catch the quarry exposed or vulnerable; the faction can act upon the quarry with impunity. 
**On a miss**, the faction’s attempts to track them down succeed, but their agents make a mess of things and allow the quarry to escape unharmed.

If the quarry is a PC: 
**On a 7-9**, the faction tracks down their location, but the PC has time to prepare for the limited forces coming their way. 
**On a 10+**, the tracking faction gets the best of their quarry; they corner the PC with overwhelming force or careful planning that leaves them little room to avoid their pursuers. 
**On a miss**, someone close to the PC tips them o! early to the faction’s search...and an opportunity or weakness the PC can exploit"

**On a 10+**, the target takes the bait; the instigating faction strikes a terrible blow, destroys a vulnerable asset, or undermines a key relationship or alliance. 
**On a 7-9**, the target avoids the worst of the trap, but causes enough trouble to embarrass themselves; they take a -1 ongoing to Strength until they reestablish their reputation.
