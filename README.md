# NIMUE_DISCORD_BOT BETA 0.2

An unnoficial bot for playing Urban Shadows 2E
Using Quick Start Rules, when full book becomes available in PDF Ill slowly update

## STATUS: ONLINE

Listens too:
- $help 
- $ayuda

The bot supports normal commands and slash commands, you can use them interchangeably, for now pinging the bot to use normal commands isn't needed but as people get to using the bot it might be needed int he future.  

Most of the playbook moves aren't present yet. Will be a slow work to add all of them, if you want to help adding them check the Help Form.

Supported languages:
- English
- Spanish [Pending to translate]

Supported commands:
- Normal and Slash commands in both languages
